# REFLECTIONS
# -------------------------------------------------------
1. How long did you spend working on this project?
I honestly don't know but I must say that I take my time
2. What was the most rewarding challenge you conquered?
I'm already a rails developer, I'm just making sure I know all the basics in ruby
3. What two additional features did you build? Why?
Anyone should be able to send a todolist or keep it somewhere else so I added the export method to the udacilist class. And changing priorities is easier now with the "higher_priority" and "lower_priority" methods.
4. Where do you still have room to grow?
I'd love to make complex gems
